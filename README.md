Data Structures and Algorithms using C
This repository contains a collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) programs implemented in the C programming language. All programs are written by me from scratch as part of my learning and practice
About the Repository
The purpose of this repository is to:
Learn and practice Data Structures using C
Understand algorithm logic and memory concepts
Improve problem-solving skills
Prepare for coding interviews and technical exams
Technologies Used
C Programming Language
GCC Compiler
VS Code / Turbo C / Any C IDE
Git & GitHub for version control
Topics Covered
This repository includes programs related to:
Basic Concepts
Arrays
Strings
Functions
Pointers
Data Structures
Linked List (Singly / Circular / Doubly)
Stack
Queue
Algorithms
Searching (Linear Search, Binary Search)
Sorting (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort)
(Modify this list according to your programs.)
How to Run the Programs
Install a C compiler (GCC recommended)
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/shashiraju812/DSLAB
Open the folder:
cd DSLAB
Compile the program:
gcc filename.c -o output
Run the program:
./output
Learning Objectives
Through this repository, I am focusing on:
